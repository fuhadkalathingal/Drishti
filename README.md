# DRISHTI

**Slogan:** From vision to voice

---

## Project Overview

**Drishti** is an innovative assistive technology project designed to help **locked-in patients** communicate using **eye gestures**. By leveraging real-time **face and eye tracking**, the system converts subtle eye movements and blinks into actionable commands or text, enabling patients with severe motor impairments to interact with computers and convey messages.

---

## Key Features

- **Blink Detection:** Detects fast and slow blinks for communication inputs.
- **Eye Direction Recognition:** Tracks gaze directions (left, right, up, down, center) for navigation.
- **Hybrid Communication:** Combines blink patterns and gaze gestures to allow complex inputs with minimal effort.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Uses **MediaPipe Face Landmarker** for precise, low-latency eye tracking.
- **Customizable Thresholds:** Automatically or manually calibrated for different lighting and camera conditions.

## Target Users

- Patients with **locked-in syndrome** or severe motor disabilities.  
- Individuals unable to use traditional input devices like keyboard or mouse.  

---

## Goal

To transform **vision into voice**, enabling users to communicate naturally and efficiently through their eye movements, improving quality of life and independence.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** for video capture  
- **MediaPipe** for facial landmark and blendshape detection  
- Modular Python classes for **blink and gaze detection**
